# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the prayer invitation.

## Files

- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels)
- `preview-image.jpg` - Social media preview image (1200x630 pixels)

## Favicon Creation

To create a proper favicon:

1. Design a simple icon with Islamic/medical theme
2. Use online favicon generators like:
   - https://favicon.io/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Save as `favicon.ico` with multiple sizes

## Preview Image Creation

To create a social media preview image:

1. Create a 1200x630 pixel image
2. Include:
   - Event title
   - Date and venue
   - Islamic/medical visual elements
   - Gold and green color scheme
3. Save as `preview-image.jpg`

## Current Status

- ✅ Directory structure created
- ⏳ Favicon needs to be created
- ⏳ Preview image needs to be created

## Temporary Solution

The HTML file includes fallback handling for missing assets, so the invitation will work without these files, but they should be added for optimal social sharing and branding.
